## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

1.Applicant Side Virtual Application Process: Applicants submit details, upload resumes, and answer predefined questions. Scenario-Based Simulations: Role-playing exercises, situational judgment tests (SJTs), and case studies tailored to specific industries. Automated Assessments: AI-based grading for aptitude tests, personality evaluations, and skill assessments. Live or Pre-Recorded Interviews: Integration with video interview platforms for real-time or asynchronous evaluation.
2.Selector Side (Recruiters/Evaluators) Customizable Assessment Criteria: Define key competencies, scoring rubrics, and weighting systems. AI-Powered Matching & Scoring: Automated ranking based on applicant performance and predefined benchmarks. Real-Time Decision Dashboard: View candidate profiles, analytics, and comparative reports. Collaboration & Feedback Tools: Share evaluations among team members and provide applicant feedback.
3.System Capabilities User Authentication & Role Management: Secure access for applicants, selectors, and administrators. Data Analytics & Reports: Generate insights on applicant performance, selection trends, and process efficiency. Integration with HR Systems: Compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and Learning Management Systems (LMS). Multi-Device Support: Access via desktop, tablets, and mobile devices for flexible participation.
